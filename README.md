## Hello! Get to Know Me ðŸ‘‹

I love to find solutions to real-world problems and to learn new ways of doing things!
I've always love computers since I was a kid, so becoming a Software Engineer always felt right. When I'm not coding or learning new skills, I love to play guitar/piano and make music. Feel free to take a listen! Also check out my site below:
